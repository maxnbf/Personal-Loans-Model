# Personal-Loans-Model

This classification project aims to predict whether loan applications will be accepted or rejected based on socioeconomic and other demographic factors which are further outlined in the essay. Such factors include, but are not limited to, gender, marital status, and credit history. This projectâ€™s applications affect both applicants and lenders in the market. Applicants would be able to identify why their application may be rejected and/or if their application could be accepted. On the other hand, financial institutions will be able to more quickly and easily assess if applicants can be classified as accepted or rejected. These wide ranging implications, in a personal loan market that is at near-record highs, make this classification problem worth answering.

To run the code, open project.ipynb in any IDE that supports Jupyter Notebook, and run all cells.
